# Development and Description
`taskdash` is a web-based productivity application, utilizing minimalistic design to allow less clutter for users. Built using a basic web development stack. (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) 

The project offers two key productivity tools in a single interface, namely: 

1. A to-do list that includes a limit of seven items, to prevent stagnation through overplanning––lessening actual productivity for the user. The app stores the list in the browser's local storage for persistence across sessions, allowing the user’s tasks to be saved even upon exiting the website. Visual feedback is provided upon reaching the task limit, and both the input box and the add task CTA are disabled, rendering further task additions impossible.  

2. A Pomodoro timer to allow users to cut work sessions at a healthy pace, helping with optimal focus in completing their tasks. The timer includes controls to give users leeway in cases of focused work stoppage, giving them the option to resume, pause, and reset. Text and box shadows were implemented to give the helper widget a bit more visual pop, resolving the initially bland look of the Pomodoro timer widget.

The app was developed with user experience in mind, which led the developer to opt for a clean, minimal, and accessible UI. In line with this, dynamic design to cater to different screen sizes have been implemented. Currently the project’s development is still ongoing, with further improvements lined up such as additional helper widgets, and more. The developer’s goal was to combine separate, commonly used productivity tools into a compact tool that’s both lightweight and distraction-free––through the help of the minimal design utilized by the developer. The current app version is entirely run on the client’s side, removing the necessity of backend and external dependencies.
